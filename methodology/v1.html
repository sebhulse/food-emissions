            J Poore and T Nemecek's 2019 paper, published by the University of
            Oxford, suggests that today's food supply chain contributes 26% of
            total anthropogenic GHG emissions [1, p. 1]. Further, meat,
            aquaculture, eggs and dairy use ~83% of farmland and account for
            ~57% of Greenhouse Gas emissions , despite providing only 37% of our
            protein and 18% of our calories [1, p. 4]. They conclude that a
            transition towards plant-based diets could result in a land-use
            reduction of 76% and a 49% reduction in GHG emissions.

            Mike Berners-Lee builds on this (and other) data to provide new
            perspectives on the impacts of consumer dietary change [2, 3]. Their
            data aggregation highlights how conscious everyday choices can
            influence individual carbon footprints. For example, a Meat &
            Dairy-based weekly shop (UK) accounts for around 61kg of carbon,
            whereas a Vegan-based weekly shop accounts for around 36kg of carbon
            emissions, a 40% reduction. This data, combined with Public Health
            England data on daily calorie meal proportions underpins the
            approach for this food emissions tool.
          </p>
          <h2>Data</h2>
          <p>
            Table 1 shows the average carbon impact of Vegan, Vegetarian, and
            Meat & Dairy diets which has been extrapolated from the 'week's food
            shoppping' data in 'How Bad are Bananas?' [2]. Additional data for
            'No red meat' diets and consideration for food waste and food miles
            are included in [2, p. 113-114], but are omitted here to reduce user
            decision fatigue and complexity.

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Rather than requiring people to provide an itemised breakdown of all
            foods and drink consumed and their resultant carbon impact (e.g. [5,
            6]); a simpler approach is taken. Here, people need only provide
            information about which diet was followed for each meal on each day.
            This reduces the time and resources required to submit this data,
            improving the chances of representative data submission.
          </p>
          <h2>Calculation</h2>
          <p>
            To calculate carbon emissions for each meal, the calculation used
            is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >Meal Carbon Emissions (kgCO2e) = Proportion of meal daily intake
              * Diet emissions per day (kgCO2e)</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            To calculate the carbon emissions for each day, the
            <strong>sum</strong> of all Meal Carbon Emissions is taken. This is
            possible because the tool restricts user input to allow only one
            breakfast, lunch, evening meal and 'everything else' per day,
            resulting in 100% proportional meal (and therefore carbon emission)
            representation.
          </p>
          <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            This methodology takes only one aggregated, averaged food emissions
            data source into account, and could be improved to include a range
            of data to better reflect scientific consensus. Future methodology
            versions could introduce a wider array of data sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            This methodology assumes a daily breakfast, lunch, evening meal and
            'everything else' (snacks) meal structure. Those not following this
            structure are requested to document their meals 'representatively',
            to reflect their diet throughout the day (via error message). While
            this may introduce some data inconsistency, the impact is expected
            to be minimal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, this methodology assumes individual carbon emissions for
            time periods of 1 day or more. This is not suitable for one-off
            meals (e.g. business lunches) or for more than one person. These
            scenarios should be accounted for manually; or multiple forms should
            be submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this tool relies on individuals to record their consumption,
            time or resource use constraints may limit data collection,
            resulting in data inconsistencies being introduced. Organisations
            may mitigate for this effect by encouraging data submission.

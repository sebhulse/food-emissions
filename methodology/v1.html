          J Poore et al's pivotal paper of 2019, published by the University of
          Oxford, states that today's food supply chain contributes 26% of total
          anthropogenic GHG emissions [1, p. 1]. Further, meat, aquaculture,
          eggs and dairy use ~83% of farmland and account for ~57% of Greenhouse
          Gas (GHG) emissions, despite providing only 37% of our protein and 18%
          of our calories [1, p. 4]. They conclude that a transition towards
          plant-based diets could result in a land-use reduction of 76% and a
          49% reduction in GHG emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mike Berners-Lee's books 'How bad are bananas?' [2] and 'There is no
          Planet B' [3] build on this (and other) data to provide new
          perspectives on the impacts of consumer dietary change. Their data
          aggregation highlights how conscious everyday choices can influence
          individual carbon footprints. For example, a Meat & Dairy-based weekly
          shop (UK) accounts for around 61kg of carbon, whereas a Vegan-based
          weekly shop accounts for around 36kg of carbon emissions, a 40%
          reduction. This data, combined with UK government data on daily
          calorie meal proportions underpins the approach for this food
          emissions tool. See Approach for more information.
        </p>
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
          Table 1 shows the average carbon impact of Vegan, Vegetarian, and Meat
          & Dairy diets which has been extrapolated from the 'week's food
          shoppping' data in 'How Bad are Bananas?' [2]. Additional data for 'No
          red meat' diets and consideration for food waste and food miles are
          included in [2, p. 113-114], but are omitted here to reduce user
          decision fatigue and complexity.

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Rather than requiring people to provide an itemised breakdown of all
          foods and drink consumed and their resultant carbon impact (e.g. [5,
          6]); a simpler approach is taken. Here, people need only provide
          information about which diet was followed for each meal on each day.
          This reduces the time and resources required to submit this data,
          improving the chances of representative data submission.
        </p>
        <h2>Calculation</h2>
        <p>
          To calculate carbon emissions for each meal, the calculation used is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code
            >Meal Carbon Emissions (kgCO2e) = Proportion of meal daily intake *
            Diet emissions per day (kgCO2e)</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          To calculate the carbon emissions for each day, the
          <strong>sum</strong> of all Meal Carbon Emissions is taken. This is
          possible because the tool restricts user input to allow only one
          breakfast, lunch, evening meal and 'everything else' per day,
          resulting in 100% proportional meal (and therefore carbon emission)
          representation.
        </p>
        <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          This methodology takes only one aggregated food emissions data source
          into account, and could be improved to include a range of data to
          better reflect scientific consensus. Future methodology versions could
          introduce a wider array of data sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          This methodology assumes a daily breakfast, lunch, evening meal and
          'everything else' meal structure. It is recognised that this structure
          is not followed by everyone. Therefore, those not following this
          structure are requested to document their meals 'representatively', to
          reflect their diet throughout the day (via error message). While this
          may introduce some data inconsistency, the impact is expected to be
          minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, this methodology assumes individual carbon emissions for time
          periods of 1 day or more. This is not suitable for one-off meals (e.g.
          business lunches) or for more than one person. These scenarios should
          be accounted for manually; or multiple forms should be submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this tool relies on individuals to record their consumption,
          time or resource use constraints may limit data collection, resulting
          in data inconsistencies being introduced. Organisations may mitigate
          for this effect by encouraging data submission.

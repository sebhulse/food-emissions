        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Rather than requiring people to provide an itemised breakdown of all
          foods and drink consumed and their resultant carbon impact (e.g. [3,
          4]); a simpler approach is taken. Here, people need only provide
          information about which diet was followed for each meal on each day.
          This reduces the time and resources required to submit this data,
          improving the chances of representative data submission.
        </p>
        <h2>Calculation</h2>
        <p>
          To calculate carbon emissions for each meal, the calculation used is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code
            >Meal Carbon Emissions (kgCO2e) = Proportion of meal daily intake *
            Diet emissions per day (kgCO2e)</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          To calculate the carbon emissions for each day, the
          <strong>sum</strong> of all Meal Carbon Emissions is taken. This is
          possible because the tool restricts user input to allow only one
          breakfast, lunch, evening meal and 'everything else' per day,
          resulting in 100% proportional meal (and therefore carbon emission)
          representation.
        </p>
        <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          This methodology assumes a daily breakfast, lunch, evening meal and
          'everything else' meal structure. It is recognised that this structure
          is not followed by everyone. Therefore, those not following this
          structure are requested to document their meals 'representatively', to
          reflect their diet throughout the day (via error message). While this
          may introduce some data inconsistency, the impact is expected to be
          minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, this methodology assumes individual carbon emissions for time
          periods of 1 day or more. This is not suitable for one-off meals (e.g.
          business lunches) or for more than one person. These scenarios should
          be accounted for manually; or multiple forms should be submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this tool relies on individuals to record their consumption,
          time or resource use constraints may limit data collection, resulting
          in data inconsistencies being introduced. Organisations may mitigate
          for this effect by encouraging data submission.

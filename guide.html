        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>What is this?</strong> This website enables concious
          businesses and people to measure their food & drink emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calculating itemised food and drink emissions can be challenging and
          inefficient [1][2]. This tool takes a different approach by using
          aggregated data, standardising the process, and empowering people to
          quickly and conveinently record their emissions. The details can be
          found in the <a href="/methodology.html">Methodology</a> section.
        </p>
        <h2>Who?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Who is this for?</strong> Environmentally concious business
          employees and individuals wanting to measure and reduce their food and
          drink emissions.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Why should I do this?</strong> By measuring food and drink
          emissions, we're taking the first step to emissions reduction. If your
          business already tracks transport emissions, the case for measuring
          your food and drink emissions is convincing. For example, by choosing
          Vegan over a Meat and Dairy diet for 2 days could save the equivalent
          of travelling 89 miles by train in emissions (kgCO2e)[3].
        </p>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>How do I use this?</strong> The fundamental idea is to measure
          the emissions of the food and drink that a business pays for on an
          individual basis. For example, if an individual goes on a 2 day
          business trip, these food and drink emissions are recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the <a href="/">Home</a> page, you can optionally enter the trip
          start date, then the number of days of the trip. Next, for each meal
          of the day including Breakfast, Lunch, Evening Meals, and Everything
          Else (snacks), the number of days that each diet (including Vegan,
          Vegetarian and Meat & Dairy) is followed should be selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry if your diet doesn't follow the standard Breakfast, Lunch,
          Evening Meal format, simply distribute your 'days' to each mealtime
          however you feel best represents your diet for each day. You must
          allocate all of your trip days to each meal time.
        </p>
